As a result of these efforts, and despite the heavy workload within the war economy, a good regulation has now been achieved with the order on the granting of the housework day, which came into force on 1 November 1943. Previously, it was at the discretion of the company managers to what extent they took into account the double burden of the working housewife. According to the new order, there is now a legal entitlement to the granting of the housework day.""

 ""The piece is forwarded for further processing. This woman's work is strenuous and exhausting, and yet her face reveals that she will also fulfil it with the conscientiousness and devotion to duty that is characteristic of her entire gender. Isn't this young newspaper setter or secretary shown in one of the pictures help personified? Always ready, always amiable, quick and skilful at work, no office is imaginable without her. In fact, she often becomes the soul of the whole company thanks to her understanding co-operation, her strong empathy and her responsiveness to all wishes and concerns. Simple, nicely dressed and well-groomed, she sits in front of her typewriter in a bright workroom, looks intently at the shorthand pad next to her, quickly repeats the dictation in her mind, the pointers are already ready on the keys, and in a few seconds the hail of keystrokes will rain down, which, like hardly any other work, gives the impression of feverish concentration.""]",['The woman invented a simple device that used a copper ring to hold the workpiece in place for welding.']

 ""the leading German poets came together in Weimar, as they have done every year since 1928. Their conference focussed on the questions that are of burning concern to all poets: the right of poetry to exist in war in general, the creative effect of a war fought for the freedom of the people and - as the last and most difficult question - the personal attitude of a creatively gifted person who wants to let his poetic work grow from the experience of this time. In his lecture, Wilhelm Schäser, the master of the German anecdote, answered the question of poetry's right to exist during the war. In a wide-ranging historical review, he demonstrated that the strongest German poetry was heroic epic, indeed that genuine German poetry was virtually born out of war. And at all times, when it was not mercenaries but the man of valour in the origin of the warrior who defended his homeland, it was the poet's highest task to express his valour.""
 'The young poet Gerhard Schümann, who was wounded as a battalion commander, spoke of the need to first stand as a human being so that the immense events of this war can later be interpreted in a true poem. ""Silent reverence will be around him before the infinite suffering in this world, before the silent greatness of the sacrifice of the soldiers and the homeland, before the silent majesty of death. So the poet will have to remain silent and do his duty, prove himself as a human being, as a man, as a soldier. Prove himself in the dull beat of the marches, in the roaring storm of the attacks, in the deathly loneliness of advanced defences, prove himself before the twitching agony of wounded and dying comrades. At first he will be deeply shocked to see all this, then his eyes will harden and his heart will become steadier. And he will look with a holy, sober gaze and quietly take it all in. Then one day the inner command will come: what he has taken in wants to come out.'
 'documentary value is doubtful, as the descriptions remain one-sided, burdened with the duality of experience. In almost all women\'s books, the war is treated as a period of their own lives, but not yet overlooked in its new demands on women or as a high and harsh law. The poet Agnes Negel is an exception. She has included the war in some of her poems in the same way as love, passion, motherhood and nature. In these poems - only a few of them - war is a difficult and painful part of the great life to which birth and death, suffering and cruelty, beauty and horror belong in equal measure.\n\nFields of application\n\nThe women\'s areas of deployment were very diverse and multiplied with its length. It is good to gain an overview of this. The anthology ""German Women - German Loyalty - 1914-1922"", edited by Charlotte von Hadeln (Traditionsverlag, RM 5.50), attempts to provide such an overview.']","[""The poet who wrote the poem 'At midnight' is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.""]"

 'which sees in the denial of the covenant the great response of women to their people and to the human rights of this people. Through this externalisation of the ""mother\'s vocation"" into the ""mother\'s profession"", the children of these mothers were to become joyless, unblessed and thus powerless and soulless. Devilish forces under the leadership of Marxism had tried to lead German women down this path - it is therefore our task to reawaken the divine in her and to allow the vocation of motherhood to become the door through which the German woman recognises her vocation as mother of the nation. She will then shape her life in a way that is not self-centred, but committed to the people. We know and believe that all German women will gradually take up this call, if only we continue to clear the path that a wrong era has somewhat blocked. More and more faithful helpers will join our ranks, who will go to work as joyfully and strongly as we have done so far.'

 ""The lover's pleas and joyful assurances to his beloved are captured in the richly original nature of this love pledge. Secretly slipped away, it is a talisman that the beloved hides, whose magic she feels in all the hours of the day and in the dreams of the night. The letter lies in the chest, in the wardrobe, perhaps she carries it secretly in her sorrow. In the morning she will conjure it up, and in the evening she will caress it. When she is sad, she will be comforted, when she doubts, she will be strengthened in her faith. The happiness of the tender unfolding of the closed letter! Wonderful shrine! Closed together, the hand can embrace it, and yet it contains everything that makes up life. The love of two people is only a small event in the great event of the world, and yet, when it unfolds, the great event will enter into it, and it will become truth that what takes place in man finds participation and confirmation in the eternal fulfilment""

 ""On the tram, people make room for children everywhere. A mother who leaves her little son behind does not love her child. Only in church or temple do people let children go when they steal away from their mother's side and start playing together, whether it's a Christian church or temple. They run riot, laugh or get up to mischief. The uninhibited expression of the natural instinct is the supreme law in the Japanese educational system, until - the entry into school, which means the entry into life, changes everything. Despite the arbitrariness of pre-school education, the wise guiding hand of the Japanese mother can be recognised, and the child's first tender inclinations, such as love of nature and reverence for ancestral tablets, are placed in the child's soul by the mother's hand. It is the woman who gives direction to the young life from an early age. She is always at home, there for the child, because the Japanese man usually only arrives at dinnertime""

In the earliest times, the bride did not enter her husband's house directly through the front door, but through a compartment next to the door that was cut through for this purpose, through which the woman had to crawl and which was immediately closed again with clay.

They also contribute to the aesthetic of simplicity and minimalism that is valued in Japanese culture. Getas, on the other hand, are traditional Japanese footwear that elevate the foot above the ground, protecting it from dirt and water. Wearing getas with both traditional kimonos and European clothing signifies the blend of Japanese tradition with Western influences.

What information can be found in the context?,"The context discusses the importance of not disturbing the natural mental and spiritual development of a child, the need for adults to balance factual knowledge with formal ability, the significance of celebrating a child's small achievements, and the challenges faced in modern life with changing roles and responsibilities.","['At the same time, however, factual knowledge, the intellectual ""naming"" has been developed. Now there is a contradiction between overdeveloped factual knowledge and underdeveloped formal ability.

But one thing should be possible: not to disturb the natural mental and spiritual development of the child, not to violate its image with templates and corrections.

They do not lead to happiness, because life does not mean being happy either.
