A tongue played its childish game around us, picking up stones and throwing them into the wide ditch running along the edge of the garden.

What is the significance of the sliding wooden doors and getas in Japanese daily life?,"n waves he faithful. ""Let's go, ask the waves!""
Small boat on the waves,
comes pulling so lonely.
When the sea sang wildly
your tale was swallowed up.
See no land in the vastness,
Only the infinite.
I've been in Japan for over a month now and am completely acclimatised. The rolling, scraping sound of the sliding wooden doors, which are opened early in the morning and closed late in the evening, this early morning and night music of daily Japanese life has also become commonplace for me, as has the little third in which the getas, the Japanese wooden sandals with the two little paws under the soles, sound on the pavement. Everyone wears them with their kimono and European clothing. We quickly got used to them too, as it is very pleasant not to have your feet in direct contact with the ground in the scorching Abern of the Soden. I already know the man who sings out his vegetables, the fruit and fish man who sells his wares in typical and monotonous",{'filename': '1941_19.txt'},"The sliding wooden doors and getas are significant in Japanese daily life as they represent traditional Japanese culture and lifestyle. The sliding doors, known as 'fusuma' or 'shoji', are integral to Japanese architecture, allowing for flexibility in space usage and promoting a sense of harmony with nature by easily opening up to the outside environment. They also contribute to the aesthetic of simplicity and minimalism that is valued in Japanese culture. Getas, on the other hand, are traditional Japanese footwear that elevate the foot above the ground, protecting it from dirt and water. Wearing getas with both traditional kimonos and European clothing signifies the blend of Japanese tradition with Western influences. The sounds of these elements, the rolling and scraping of the doors and the clacking of getas, have become a familiar backdrop to daily life, reflecting the deep-rooted customs and the adaptability of the Japanese people to incorporate these traditions into modern living."

In order to fulfil these two purposes, woollen dresses, silk blouses, in short all dresses and blouses that cannot be washed or are rarely washed, are sewn with a bottom",{'filename': '1942_15.txt'},"The purpose of sewing woollen dresses and silk blouses with a bottom is to protect them from dust and dirt accumulation. Since these garments cannot be washed frequently or at all, the bottom acts as a barrier that can be easily cleaned or replaced, thus preserving the main fabric of the dress or blouse. This method is particularly useful in maintaining the garment's appearance and longevity, especially in an era where daily dusting with a damp mop is recommended to keep dust levels low in living spaces."
